Roy project

Roy is a token that built on the AltHash blockchain. Roy starts with the token used in the shopping mall and will extends to the use of music lessons and psychological counseling. The reason for this is to reduce the speculative nature used only in the exchange and to create sustainable and stable demand outside the exchange as well as in real life.

Although a corporation issues stocks and investors buy and sell stocks on the stock exchange, a corporation still earn a lot of money in life. When this happens, the value of stocks is more stable and higher. If a corporation were to be used only on the stock exchange, it would be more speculative and there would be many side effects such as inflation that are often seen in the cryptographic currency market today.

The cryptographic market should no longer remain only on the exchange. It should be a realistic vision, not unrealistic white paper or road map. Tokens, in particular, will evolve like the APP market today only if they focus on actual use as the APP market has evolved today.
For this reason, Roy is more focused on actual use beyond the exchange. From an investor's point of view of investing in Roy, we will be able to trust and invest more when we have a variety of demand channels other than the exchange.
